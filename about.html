<h2>Hi, I'm Skyler</h2>
<p>I live right here in College Park with my wife Victoria and our son Bennett. After spending seven years in corporate marketing and operations, I realized something: I'm really good at seeing potential in things and creating systems to bring that potential to life.</p>
<p>That skill translates beautifully to landscape design. When I look at your front yard, I don't just see what's there - I see what could be there. The way plants can frame your entryway. How strategic color placement draws the eye. The transformation that happens when you combine Florida-friendly plants with thoughtful design.</p>
<p>I started College Park Landscaping because I wanted to build something creative that serves my community. Not another corporate landscaping company that sends different crews and uses cookie-cutter designs. Something personal, where I work directly with homeowners to design outdoor spaces they're genuinely excited about.</p>
<p>My approach is straightforward: we'll walk your property together, I'll share ideas and plant recommendations, and we'll create a design that fits your vision and budget. Then I'll install it properly - the right plants in the right places, with attention to detail that shows in the finished product.</p>
<div class="story-highlight">
<p><strong>What makes me different:</strong> I combine design thinking with hands-on execution. You get someone who understands Florida horticulture, has an eye for aesthetics, and actually lives three streets over. Your landscape becomes part of our shared neighborhood - and that matters to me.</p>

<h2>Why Local Design Matters</h2>
<div class="reasons-grid">
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">01</div>
<h3>I Know What Works Here</h3>
<p>I've spent years observing which plants thrive in College Park's specific conditions - the sun patterns, soil types, and microclimates. That local knowledge means your landscape will actually flourish, not struggle.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">02</div>
<h3>Design for the Neighborhood</h3>
<p>College Park has character - historic homes, mature trees, architectural diversity. I design landscapes that complement that character rather than importing generic suburban templates that don't fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">03</div>
<h3>Direct Collaboration</h3>
<p>You work with me from concept to completion. No sales reps, no project managers, no crews who've never met you. Just direct communication with the person who actually designs and installs your landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">04</div>
<h3>Long-Term Thinking</h3>
<p>I'm not installing your landscape and disappearing to the next subdivision. I live here. I'll see how your plants mature over time, and I'm available when you have questions or want to expand the design.</p>
