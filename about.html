<h1>About College Park Landscaping</h1>

<h2>Hi, I'm Skyler</h2>
<p>I live right here in College Park with my wife Victoria and our son Bennett. After spending years in corporate marketing, I realized something: the best work happens when you actually care about the people you're serving.</p>
<p>That's why I started College Park Landscaping. Not to build some massive company, but to take care of my neighbors' yards the way I take care of my own - with attention to detail, consistency, and genuine pride in the work.</p>
<p>I see the difference between the big Orlando landscaping companies and what I'm building here. Those crews rush through 15-20 yards a day. They send different people every week. They don't know your name or care about the details.</p>
<p>When you hire me, you're getting someone who lives three streets over. Someone who waves when they see you at Stardust Coffee. Someone who actually cares that your yard looks great because it's part of our shared neighborhood.</p>
<div class="story-highlight">
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> I'm not here to maximize volume. I'm here to build relationships and do excellent work for people I'll see at the grocery store. That's a different kind of business - and it matters.</p>

<h2>Why Supporting Local Matters</h2>
<div class="reasons-grid">
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">01</div>
<h3>Money Stays in the Community</h3>
<p>When you hire a local business owner, that money goes toward another family's mortgage, groceries, and kids' activities right here in College Park. Corporate companies extract value and send it elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">02</div>
<h3>Accountability & Relationships</h3>
<p>I can't hide behind a corporate phone tree. If something's not right, you can text me directly. That level of accountability only exists when the business owner lives in the neighborhood they serve.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">03</div>
<h3>Consistent Quality</h3>
<p>Big companies rotate crews constantly. You never know who's showing up or how well they'll do the job. When you hire me, you get the same person every single time - someone who remembers your preferences and notices the details.</p>
</div>
<div class="reason-card">
<div class="reason-number">04</div>
<h3>Pride in the Neighborhood</h3>
<p>Every yard I maintain reflects on me personally. I live here. I walk these streets with my family. Your yard looking great makes our whole neighborhood better - and I take that seriously.</p>
